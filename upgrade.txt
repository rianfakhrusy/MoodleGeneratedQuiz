This files describes API changes in the gnrquiz code.

=== 3.1 ===

* gnrquiz_attempt::question_print_comment_fields() has been removed. It was broken
  since at least Moodle 2.0.

* gnrquiz::confirm_start_attempt_message and mod_gnrquiz_view_object::$startattemptwarning
  have been deprecated. This functionality is now entirely handled within the
  gnrquiz access rule plugins.

* The third argument to mod_gnrquiz_renderer::start_attempt_button has been changed
  from a warning string to a mod_gnrquiz_preflight_check_form.

* mod_gnrquiz_renderer::review_next_navigation has a new optional argument. If you
  have overridden that method, consider updating your code to match.

* mod_gnrquiz\output\edit_renderer::start_section_list now takes $structure as an
  argument. If you have overridden this method (it's hard to believe anyone ever
  would) you will need to update your renderer.

* Several methods relating to preview links/buttons/urls have a new optional
  argument to make the preview be of a particular variant.


=== 2.9 ===

* There have been changes in classes/output/edit_renderer.php for MDL-40990.
  + Some methods use to take $structure & $question as the first two arguments.
    They now take $structure & $slot number. If you need $question, you can get
    it using $question = $structure->get_question_in_slot($slot);
  + Some methods used to take $gnrquiz & $question. They now take $structure & $slot
    number. You can get $question as above. $gnrquiz is $structure->get_gnrquiz().
  + initialise_editing_javascript has had some redundant arguments removed.
  Hopefully, with these changes, we will have less need to make other changes in future.

* Due to MDL-40992, you should be aware that extra slots can get added to an attempt.
  You may get slot numbers beyone the end of the original gnrquiz layout, and you
  may want to call $attemptobj->get_original_slot to find where the question
  originally came from.

* You now need to pass an instance of the mod_gnrquiz_renderer if you call
  $attemptobj->render_question or $attemptobj->render_question_at_step.

* The array values in mod_gnrquiz_links_to_other_attempts may now be either a moodle_url,
  or renderable (or null). Previously they could only be a moodle_url or null.

* The contents of the navigation block is now not just gnrquiz_nav_question_button-s.
  It can also contain gnrquiz_nav_section_heading-s. If you have overridden
  mod_gnrquiz_renderer::navigation_panel, then you may need to account for this.
  This change also has implications for the Edit gnrquiz page.


=== 2.8 ===

* Classes that were defined in various lib files have been moved to the classes
  folder to take advantage of auto-loading. This has involved renaming them.
  see the list in mod/gnrquiz/db/renamedclasses.php.

* The gnrquiz no longer handles its own \mod_gnrquiz\event\attempt_becameoverdue event,
  and so the event handler function gnrquiz_attempt_overdue_handler has been deleted.
  Also, the internal function gnrquiz_send_overdue_message has add the arguments
  changed. It now takes the $attemptobj object, not separate stdClass objects.

* Major changes to the Edit gnrquiz page.

  The goal of this work was to increase usability, and also clean up the page
  enough that it will be possible to add new features in future.

  Display of mod/gnrquiz/edit.php is now entirely generated by
  mod_gnrquiz\output\edit_renderer. This uses a helper class mod_gnrquiz\structure
  to provide details of the structure of the gnrquiz, and mod_gnrquiz\repaginate to
  alter that structure. (Actually, there are still some modification methods on
  mod_gnrquiz\structure. Expect that to be cleaned up in future.)

  The new code uses much more ajax, and there are new scripts mod/gnrquiz/edit_rest.php
  and mod/gnrquiz/repaginate.php to handle this. (Again, don't be surprised if those
  two scripts get merged in future.) Also questionbank.ajax.php (which may, in
  future, be made more generic, and moved into the core question bank code.)

  As a result of this, mod/gnrquiz/editlib.php has gone. (A few remaining functions
  were moved to locallib.php.)

  Here is a list of all the old functions or classes that have changed.
  If you used any of these in custom code, you will need to update your code.
  (Note that many of these functions should have been considered private internals
  of the gnrquiz module, and you should not have been using them!)

  From editlib.php:
      gnrquiz_remove_slot
      gnrquiz_delete_empty_page
      gnrquiz_add_page_break_after_slot    - Use methods of structure or repaginate
      gnrquiz_update_slot_maxmark          - classes instead.
      _gnrquiz_move_question
      gnrquiz_move_question_up
      gnrquiz_move_question_down

      gnrquiz_print_question_list
      gnrquiz_print_pagecontrols
      gnrquiz_print_singlequestion         - Use methods of edit_renderer instead.
      gnrquiz_print_randomquestion
      gnrquiz_print_singlequestion_reordertool
      gnrquiz_print_randomquestion_reordertool
      print_random_option_icon
      gnrquiz_print_grading_form
      gnrquiz_print_status_bar

  Moved from editlib.php to locallib.php:
      gnrquiz_question_tostring - now always returns a string (the only option used).
                               The $return argument has gone.

  Old editing JavaScript (e.g. mod/gnrquiz/edit.js) is gone. Replaced with YUI modules.


=== 2.7.1 ===

* The function gnrquiz_fire_attempt_started_event has been removed. This function
  should not have been used outside the gnrquiz, but if you were using it, you should
  trigger the event outside this function. Note that the appropriate start event is
  fired automatically by the gnrquiz_attempt_save_started function.


=== 2.7 ===

* The old gnrquiz.questions database column (comma-separated list of question ids)
  is gone, and instead the gnrquiz_question_instances table has been renamed to
  to gnrquiz_slots. Some of the columns of that table have been renamed to match
  the coding guidelines. Specifically:
      gnrquiz     -> gnrquizid
      question -> questionid
      grade    -> maxmark
  also there are two new columns:
      slot     -  numbers the questions in the gnrquiz in order, as on the edit gnrquiz page.
      page     -  new way to determine which question is on which page.
  naturally, other parts of the code and APIs have been updated to reflect that
  change.

* The following functions, which were part of the internal workings of the gnrquiz,
  have been removed.
      gnrquiz_get_slot_for_question
      gnrquiz_number_of_questions_in_gnrquiz
      gnrquiz_repaginate               (there is now a gnrquiz_repaginate_questions with a different API).
      gnrquiz_add_page_break_at        (see gnrquiz_add_page_break_after_slot)
      gnrquiz_add_page_break_after     (see gnrquiz_add_page_break_after_slot)
      gnrquiz_number_of_pages
      gnrquiz_remove_question          (see gnrquiz_remove_slot)
      gnrquiz_update_question_instance (see gnrquiz_update_slot_maxmark)

* The following internal functions have had their API changed.
      gnrquiz_delete_empty_page: has had its arguments changed to $gnrquiz and $pagenumber.
      gnrquiz_has_question_use: now takes $gnrquiz and $slot, not $questionid.


=== 2.6 ===

* As part of improving the page usability and accessibility, we updated the
  heading levels for gnrquiz module so it has a proper nesting. (MDL-41615)

* mod_gnrquiz_renderer::view_best_score has been removed. (It did not do what the
  name suggested anyway.)


=== 2.4 ===

* mod_gnrquiz_renderer::finish_review_link now requires $attemptobj to be passed in
  instead of a moodle_url.


=== Earlier changes ===

* Were not documented in this way. Sorry.
